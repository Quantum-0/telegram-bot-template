# Telegram Bot Template

This is a template repo for creating telegram bots as linux services

# TODO

- Automatically creating venv
- Automatically install all required dependencies -> telebot, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary maybe
- Create service file from template-service
- Setup service
- (Same template for flask)
- (or maybe made this template for both flask project and telebot project?)
